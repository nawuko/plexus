## ⚠️ Breaking Change: Configuration Migration to Database

**All configuration has moved from YAML files to the database.** This change is now live and affects all users upgrading from previous versions.

### What You Need to Know

- **Automatic Migration:** On first launch after upgrading, Plexus will automatically import your existing `plexus.yaml` and `auth.json` into the database
- **Backward Compatibility:** If `ADMIN_KEY` is not set as an environment variable, Plexus will attempt to read it from `plexus.yaml` and display a prominent warning banner
- **Action Required:** You should set `ADMIN_KEY` as an environment variable before the next restart to avoid the deprecation warning

**Required Environment Variables:**

```bash
export ADMIN_KEY="your-secure-admin-password"  # Recommended - will use plexus.yaml as fallback with warning
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///app/data/plexus.db"  # Optional (default shown)
export ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-generated-hex-key"   # Optional - encrypts sensitive data at rest (generate once: openssl rand -hex 32)
export PORT="4000"  # Optional
```

> **Note:** While the application will start without `ADMIN_KEY` set (by reading from `plexus.yaml`), a large deprecation warning will be displayed at startup and in the dashboard. Set `ADMIN_KEY` as an environment variable to suppress this warning.

See [Configuration Migration Details](#configuration-migration-details) below for full documentation.

## What is Plexus?

Plexus sits in front of your LLM providers and handles protocol translation, load balancing, failover, and usage tracking — transparently. Send any supported request format to Plexus and it routes to the right provider, transforms as needed, and returns the response in the format your client expects.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Unified API surface** — Accept OpenAI (`/v1/chat/completions`), Anthropic (`/v1/messages`), Responses (`/v1/responses`), Gemini (`/v1beta`), Embeddings, Audio, Images.
- **Multi-provider routing** — Route to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter, and any OpenAI-compatible provider
- **OAuth providers** — Authenticate via GitHub Copilot, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity through OAuth (no API key required)
- **Model aliasing & load balancing** — Define virtual model names backed by multiple real providers with `random`, `cost`, `performance`, `latency`, or `in_order` selectors
- **Vision fallthrough** — Automatically convert images to text descriptions for models that don't natively support vision, ensuring compatibility across all providers
- **Intelligent failover** — Exponential backoff cooldowns automatically remove unhealthy providers from rotation
- **Usage tracking** — Per-request cost, token counts, latency, and TPS metrics with a built-in dashboard
- **MCP proxy** — Proxy Model Context Protocol servers through Plexus with per-request session isolation
- **User quotas** — Per-API-key rate limiting by requests or tokens with rolling, daily, or weekly windows, along with cost restriction.
- **Admin dashboard** — Web UI for configuration, usage analytics, debug traces, and quota monitoring

## ⚡️ Unique Feature: Vision Fallthrough

Plexus allows you to use vision-capable aliases with backend models that don't natively support images. When enabled, Plexus automatically intercepts images in the request, sends them to a high-performance "descriptor" model (like Gemini 3 Flash or GPT-5.3-Codex) to generate text descriptions, and then passes those descriptions to the non-vision target.

This enables you to use cheap or specialized models for the main task while still supporting image inputs transparently.

**Setup is simple:**
Enable **Vision Fallthrough** for any model alias directly in the **Admin UI** under the **Models** tab. Specify a global "Descriptor Model" in the settings to handle the image-to-text conversion.

## Quick Start


`DATABASE_URL` is required and tells Plexus where to store usage data. Use a local SQLite file for simple deployments, or a PostgreSQL connection string for production.
`ADMIN_KEY` is required and specifies the administrative key.

### Option A — Docker

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  -v $(pwd)/config/plexus.yaml:/app/config/plexus.yaml \
  -v plexus-data:/app/data \
  -e DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app/data/plexus.db \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-generated-hex-key" \
  ghcr.io/mcowger/plexus:latest
```

### Option B — Standalone Binary

Download the latest pre-built binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mcowger/plexus/releases/latest):

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -L https://github.com/mcowger/plexus/releases/latest/download/plexus-macos -o plexus
chmod +x plexus
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://./data/plexus.db ./plexus

# Linux (x64)
curl -L https://github.com/mcowger/plexus/releases/latest/download/plexus-linux -o plexus
chmod +x plexus
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://./data/plexus.db ./plexus

# Windows (x64) — download plexus.exe from the releases page, then:
# set DATABASE_URL=sqlite://./data/plexus.db && plexus.exe
```

The binary is self-contained (no runtime or dependencies required). By default it looks for `config/plexus.yaml` relative to the working directory.

### Test it

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-plexus-my-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "fast", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

The dashboard is at `http://localhost:4000` — log in with your `adminKey`.

> **OAuth providers** (GitHub Copilot, Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, etc.) use credentials managed through the Admin UI. See [Configuration: OAuth Providers](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#oauth-providers-pi-ai).

See [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for Docker Compose, building from source, and all environment variable options.

## Features

### Routing & Load Balancing

Define model aliases backed by one or more providers. Choose how targets are selected:

| Selector | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `random` | Distribute requests randomly across healthy targets (default) |
| `in_order` | Try providers in order; fall back when one is unhealthy |
| `cost` | Always route to the cheapest configured provider |
| `performance` | Route to the highest tokens/sec provider (with exploration) |
| `latency` | Route to the lowest time-to-first-token provider |

Use `priority: api_match` to prefer providers that natively speak the incoming API format, enabling pass-through optimization.

→ See [Configuration: models](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#models)

### Multi-Provider Support

Plexus supports protocol translation between:
- **OpenAI** chat completions format (`/v1/chat/completions`)
- **OpenAI** responses  format (`/v1/responses`)
- **Anthropic** messages format (`/v1/messages`)
- **Google Gemini** native format
- Any **OpenAI-compatible** provider (DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter, Together, etc.)

A request sent in Anthropic format can be routed to an OpenAI provider — Plexus handles the transformation in both directions, including streaming and tool use.

→ See [API Reference](docs/API.md)

### OAuth Providers

Use AI services you already have subscriptions to without managing API keys. Plexus integrates with [pi-ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mariozechner/pi-ai) to support OAuth-backed providers:

- Anthropic Claude
- OpenAI Codex
- GitHub Copilot
- Google Gemini CLI
- Google Antigravity

OAuth credentials are stored in `auth.json` and managed through the Admin UI.

→ See [Configuration: OAuth Providers](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#oauth-providers-pi-ai)

### User Quota Enforcement

Limit how much each API key can consume using rolling, daily, or weekly windows:

**Limit types:** `tokens`, `requests`, or `cost` (dollar spending).

→ See [Configuration: user_quotas](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#user_quotas-optional)

### Provider Cooldowns

When a provider fails, Plexus removes it from rotation using exponential backoff: 2 min → 4 min → 8 min → ... → 5 hr cap. Successful requests reset the counter. Set disable cooldown: true on a provider to opt it out entirely.

→ See [Configuration: cooldown](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#cooldown-optional)

### MCP Proxy

Proxy [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers through Plexus. Only streamable HTTP transport is supported. Each request gets an isolated MCP session, preventing tool sprawl across clients.

→ See [Configuration: MCP Servers](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#mcp-servers-optional)

### Encryption at Rest

Plexus supports AES-256-GCM encryption for all sensitive data stored in the database, including API key secrets, OAuth access/refresh tokens, provider API keys, and MCP server headers.

**Enable encryption:**

```bash
# Generate once and persist in your .env or secret manager:
#   openssl rand -hex 32
export ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-generated-hex-key"
```

On first startup with `ENCRYPTION_KEY` set, existing plaintext values are automatically encrypted. Without the key, the system operates in plaintext mode (backward compatible). See [Configuration: Encryption](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#encryption-at-rest-optional) for details.

### Responses API

Full support for OpenAI's `/v1/responses` endpoint including stateful multi-turn conversations via `previous_response_id`, response storage with 7-day TTL, and function calling.

→ See [Responses API Reference](docs/RESPONSES_API.md)
