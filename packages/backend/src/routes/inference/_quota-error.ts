/**
 * Shared bookkeeping for a terminal quota_exceeded error thrown out of
 * routing (see `buildQuotaExceededError`): finalize the usage record,
 * persist the request + error rows, and flush debug logs. Used by every
 * inference route's catch block; the caller stays responsible for the
 * protocol-specific 429 reply (`e.routingContext.body`).
 *
 * `responseStatus` is the distinct 'quota_exceeded' (not the generic
 * 'error') so quota rejections are filterable in usage views. Error-rate
 * metrics count `!= 'success'`, so they see it the same as before.
 *
 * Persistence is intentionally fire-and-forget, matching every sibling
 * branch of the route catch blocks: both storage calls swallow their own
 * failures internally (they never reject), the debug flush writes an
 * unrelated table with no ordering dependency on either save, and the
 * caller's 429 reply must not wait on telemetry writes.
