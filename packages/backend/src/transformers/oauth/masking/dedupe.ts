/**
 * De-duplicates the `tools[]` array as a defensive safety net after
 * `cc-tools.ts`'s `stripDescriptionsAndInjectSyntheticTools()` has run with
 * our own computed `toolRenames` (see `registry.ts`).
 *
 * That injector unconditionally *prepends* a fixed set of synthetic Claude
 * Code tool stubs (Agent, NotebookEdit) to make the tool set fingerprint
 * like a real Claude Code session — required for OAuth masking; Anthropic
 * flags tool sets that don't resemble this list as non-Claude-Code traffic.
 * The injector has no awareness of the caller's actual tools, so if a
 * computed rename happens to target one of those reserved names, the result
 * is two tools with the same name — which Anthropic rejects with `400
 * tools: Tool names must be unique.`
 *
 * The registry's shapes are designed to avoid this (each shape only
 * proposes a rename when schema-compatible with the target name), so in
 * practice this should be a no-op; it's kept as a defensive backstop in
 * case a future shape's rename target collides unexpectedly. The synthetic
 * stubs are always inserted before the client's real tools, so keeping the
 * LAST occurrence of each name preserves the client's richer tool
 * definition and drops only the redundant synthetic stub.
 *
 * @param body - Parsed JSON request body (already tool-renamed and
 *   synthetic-tool-injected)
 * @returns Body with `tools[]` de-duplicated by name (same reference if no
 *   duplicates were found)
