/**
 * Resolves the ordered list of ProviderAdapters for a given route.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. Provider-level `adapter` (applies to all models under the provider)
 *   2. Model-level `adapter`   (appended after provider-level adapters)
 *
 * Each entry is an { name, options } object. Unknown adapter names are logged
 * as warnings and skipped (rather than throwing) so that a misconfigured
 * adapter doesn't take down the whole route.
 *
 * Returns an empty array when no adapters are configured — zero-cost path.
